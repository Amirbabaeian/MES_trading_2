# Backtest Configuration Example
# 
# This file demonstrates all available configuration parameters for the backtesting engine.
# Load with: BacktestConfig.from_yaml('config/backtest_config.yaml')

# Basic backtest parameters
initial_capital: 100000.0           # Starting cash for backtest ($)
commission: 0.001                   # Trading commission (0.1% = 0.001)
slippage: 0.0001                    # Price slippage per trade (0.01% = 0.0001)
cash_required_pct: 0.10             # Percent of portfolio to hold as cash (10%)

# Environment configuration
environment: dev                    # 'dev' for testing, 'production' for live
verbose: false                      # Enable verbose logging

# Futures contract specifications
# These define the contract multiplier, tick size, and margin requirements
futures_specs:
  MES:
    symbol: MES
    multiplier: 5.0                 # $5 per index point (MES is 1/10 of ES)
    tick_size: 0.25                 # Minimum price movement is 0.25 index points
    margin_requirement: 300.0       # Approximate initial margin per contract
    contract_size: 1.0              # Contracts always have size 1.0
  
  ES:
    symbol: ES
    multiplier: 50.0                # $50 per index point
    tick_size: 0.25                 # Minimum price movement is 0.25 index points
    margin_requirement: 12500.0     # Approximate initial margin per contract
    contract_size: 1.0              # Contracts always have size 1.0
  
  # Add more contracts as needed
  # NQ:
  #   symbol: NQ
  #   multiplier: 20.0
  #   tick_size: 0.25
  #   margin_requirement: 12500.0
  #   contract_size: 1.0

# Strategy-specific parameters
# These are custom parameters passed to your strategy classes
strategy_params:
  # Example: Moving Average Crossover Strategy
  moving_average_period: 20         # Period for moving average calculation
  entry_threshold: 0.001            # Entry signal threshold
  exit_threshold: -0.001            # Exit signal threshold
  
  # Example: Position sizing
  position_size: 1                  # Number of contracts per trade
  max_positions: 3                  # Maximum concurrent positions
  
  # Example: Risk management
  stop_loss_pct: 0.02               # Stop loss at 2% below entry
  take_profit_pct: 0.05             # Take profit at 5% above entry
  max_daily_loss: 5000              # Maximum loss per day ($)
  
  # Add your own custom parameters here

# Notes on Parameters:
#
# commission:
#   - Typical values: 0.0005 (0.05%) to 0.001 (0.1%)
#   - Applied as percentage to trade value
#   - Example: Selling $100,000 with 0.001 commission = $100 fee
#
# slippage:
#   - Represents price gap between order placement and execution
#   - Typical values: 0.0001 (0.01%) to 0.001 (0.1%)
#   - Applied to each trade entry and exit
#   - Example: Entry at 100.0 with 0.0001 slippage = 100.01 actual entry
#
# multiplier:
#   - Converts index points to dollar value
#   - MES: 5.0 = one point move = $5 profit/loss
#   - ES: 50.0 = one point move = $50 profit/loss
#
# margin_requirement:
#   - Approximate initial margin for the contract
#   - Actual requirements vary by broker
#   - Used for portfolio management and risk calculations
#
# cash_required_pct:
#   - Reserve cash to avoid margin calls
#   - 10% = keep 10% of portfolio as cash reserve
#   - Higher percentages = more conservative
